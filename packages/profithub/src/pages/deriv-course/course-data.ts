        title: "What is Deriv?",
        content: `
            <p>This chapter introduces the reader to Deriv as a trading platform and financial service provider.</p>
            <h3>What is Deriv?</h3>
            <p>Deriv is an online trading platform that allows individuals to participate in financial markets through simple, clearly defined trading contracts.</p>
            <p>Unlike traditional brokers that focus mainly on leveraged trading, Deriv emphasizes accessibility, transparency, and defined risk, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced traders.</p>
            <p>Deriv enables traders to speculate on market movements without owning the underlying asset. Instead, traders focus on price behavior, such as whether the market will rise or fall, whether a digit will be even or odd, or whether price will cross a specific level.</p>
            <h3>The Origin Story: Binary.com to Deriv</h3>
            <p>Before understanding Deriv today, it is important to understand where it came from.</p>
            <p>Deriv's roots trace back to Binary.com, founded in 1999, at a time when online trading was still inaccessible to most retail traders. Binary.com pioneered fixed-risk trading products known as binary options, where traders knew their maximum loss and potential profit before entering a trade.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>✓ Transparent pricing with no hidden margin calls</li>
                <li>✓ Low minimum stake requirements</li>
                <li>✓ Early adoption of synthetic indices, allowing 24/7 trading</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2020, Binary.com evolved into Deriv, reflecting a broader, more modern trading ecosystem while maintaining its original principles.</p>
            <h3>Mission & Vision</h3>
            <p>Deriv operates with a clear mission: To make online trading accessible to anyone, anywhere, while maintaining transparency and fairness.</p>
            <h3>🛡️ Global Regulation & Safety</h3>
            <p>Deriv operates under multiple regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions. Regulation helps ensure fair trade execution, protection of client funds, and responsible marketing practices.</p>

            <h3>🏪 What Is a Financial Market?</h3>
            <p>A financial market is a place where buyers and sellers exchange financial instruments. These markets exist to facilitate price discovery—finding a fair value through competition between participants.</p>
            <h3>⚖️ Buyers vs Sellers: Market Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Every trade has two opposing participants: Buyers (believe price will rise) and Sellers (believe price will fall). Price moves when one side becomes stronger than the other.</p>
            <h3>📊 Supply and Demand Fundamentals</h3>
            <p>High demand + low supply → price rises. High supply + low demand → price falls. Even in synthetic indices, this concept is simulated mathematically.</p>
            <h3>🎯 What Is a Tick?</h3>
            <p>A tick is the smallest unit of price movement. On Deriv, many contracts are tick-based, meaning time is less important than price changes.</p>

            <h3>🎮 Demo Account: Your Practice Playground</h3>
            <p>A demo account uses virtual funds to simulate real trading conditions. Prices, payouts, and contract behavior mirror real markets.</p>
            <h3>💵 The Real Account: Entering Live Markets</h3>
            <p>A real account involves actual money and requires account verification, real emotional control, and strict risk management.</p>
            <h3>📊 Understanding Balance, Equity, and Margin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Balance</strong>: Total funds in the account</li>
                <li><strong>Equity</strong>: Balance plus or minus active trades</li>
